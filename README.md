# Abstract
This study aims to compare and analyze the differences between MIDI and human performances and to create an expressive MIDI file based on this analysis. We have taken Chopin’s Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 and compared the original MIDI file with a human pianist Leung’s rendition [1], measure by measure. In the Introduction (Task A), we documented our auditory observations of the midi and performed the type. We noted how human performers convey the emotion and structural intent of the music. For the modeling part (Task B), we developed a model based on our detailed observations in task A which modifies unperformed MIDI files to emulate human expressiveness, with attention to accented notes, dynamic transitions, and rhythm adjustments. In the discussion section (Task C), we reflected the model in simulating human performance details and proposed potential weakness for the model to refine.
